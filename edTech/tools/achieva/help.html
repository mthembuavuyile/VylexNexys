        <h2>Data Management</h2>
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Achieva stores all your data directly in your web browser's <strong>Local Storage</strong> (under the key <code>academiaTrackData_v2</code>). This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Your data is private and local:</strong> It is not sent to any server and remains on the device and browser you used to enter it.</li>
                <li><strong>No cloud sync:</strong> Data entered in one browser (e.g., Chrome on your laptop) will not automatically appear in another browser or on another device (e.g., Safari on your phone).</li>
                <li><strong>Risk of data loss:</strong> If you clear your browser's cache, cookies, site data, or specifically its Local Storage, <strong>your Achieva data will be permanently deleted.</strong> Be cautious when clearing browser data.</li>
                <li>Consider manually backing up important information if needed, for example, by regularly printing reports.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Tips for Best Results</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Keep Information Updated:</strong> Regularly add new subjects, assessments, and update scores as you receive them for the most accurate tracking.</li>
            <li><strong>Accurate Assessment Weights:</strong> Ensure the weights for assessments within a subject correctly reflect their contribution to the final grade. For full accuracy, weights for all assessments in a subject should ideally sum to 100%.</li>
            <li><strong>Use the "What's Needed" Feature:</strong> For subject grade goals, pay attention to the "what's needed" messages to understand the performance required in future assessments.</li>
            <li><strong>Set Realistic Goals:</strong> Use the Goals tab to set achievable targets and monitor your progress towards them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt><strong>Why is my GPA / Subject Grade calculated this way?</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                <p>GPA is calculated based on a standard 4.0 scale, converting your average percentage in graded portions of subjects (weighted by credits) to GPA points. Subject grades are based on the sum of (your score / max score) * weight for each graded assessment.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><strong>What happens if I clear my browser's cache/data?</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                <p>As mentioned in "Data Management," clearing your browser's site data or Local Storage will likely delete all your Achieva data. Please be careful.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><strong>Can I use Achieva on multiple devices or browsers and sync my data?</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                <p>No, Achieva currently stores data locally in the browser you use. There is no automatic syncing feature across devices or browsers.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><strong>The Analytics tab is empty or shows placeholders. When will it work?</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                <p>The Analytics tab is a feature planned for future development. It currently serves as a placeholder for visual charts and trends which require more data and a charting library integration.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>How is the "Current GPA" on the dashboard calculated if not all my subjects are fully graded?</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                <p>The "Current GPA" considers the subjects you've added and their credits. For each subject, it uses the <em>average percentage achieved on the parts of the subject that have already been graded</em> to estimate that subject's contribution to your GPA. As more assessments are graded, the GPA will become more representative of your final standing.</p>
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>We hope Achieva helps you succeed in your academic endeavors!</p>
